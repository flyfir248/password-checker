### Password Strength Checker
This is a simple password strength checker written in Python. It checks for the strength of a given password based on certain criteria.

#### Getting Started
To use this password strength checker, you will need to have a basic understanding of Python programming. The code is written in Python 3.

#### Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine in order to run this code. You can download it from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/.

#### Installing
There is no need to install any additional packages as all the modules used in the code are part of the Python Standard Library.

#### Running the code
You can run the code by navigating to the directory where the script is located and running the following command:

````
python password_strength_checker.py
````

You will be prompted to enter a password, the code will then check the strength of the password based on the following criteria:

Length of the password should be at least 8 characters
Should contain at least 1 uppercase letter
Should contain at least 1 lowercase letter
Should contain at least 1 numerical digit
Should contain at least 1 special character
The code will then print out a message indicating whether the password is 'Strong' or 'Weak' based on whether it meets the above criteria.
